Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Laravel Part

-   composer install
-   php artisan migrate (if you are running the project for the first time)
-   php artisan serve (to serve the project, usually on port 8000)

## React Part

### React file structure

All files can be found in `./resources/js`

-   Components (All small components should go here)
-   Layouts
-   Pages (Each page should go here, they can be in sub-folders too)

### Run react app
